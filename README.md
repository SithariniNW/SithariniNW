<h1><a href="https://github.com/SithariniNW">Hi, I'm Sitharini! <br/> <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/sitharini-wewalwala-8317a9264">Cybersecurity Student</a>

<h2>About Me</h2>
I am currently a final-year student at the University of Technology, Sydney. Studying for a bachelor's in cybersecurity. I finished my secondary education at Musaeus College, Colombo. Then I enrolled at UTS College Sri Lanka to pursue UTS Foundation studies and a Diploma in Information Technology, which became my pathway to UTS in Sydney.

My goal is to complete my degree at UTS and become a professional in the field of cybersecurity as a SOC or cybersecurity analyst.
